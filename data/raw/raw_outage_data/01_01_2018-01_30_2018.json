At approximately 5:20 AM a switch malfunctioned at North White Plains Station, taking one of two tracks in the area out of service. Crews were dispatched to the scene and were able to make repairs by 6:06 AM. Also, at 7:12 AM a train became temporarily disabled with damaged third rail shoes in the vicinity of Scarsdale Station due to a third rail \"pull apart.\" This is when two sections of third rail separate (pull apart) at a point where they are joined. (This is caused when rail \"shrinks\" due to extremely cold weather, and separates at a joint.) Again, this took one of two tracks out of service in the area, adding to delays. Crews were able to clear the train from the area at approximately 8:40 AM, and the track condition was repaired by 9:15 AM.
