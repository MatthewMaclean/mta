Yesterday, we announced the decision to close the tunnel for 18 months beginning in 2019, so that we can address as quickly and efficiently as possible the critical work needed in the tunnel's two tubes. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy flooded the tubes with seven million gallons of salt water, heavily damaging vital infrastructure and systems. Service was restored some 10 days later, and conditions were and continue to be closely monitored. While the tunnels are safe, a full reconstruction is required. After a robust public outreach process over the last few months, and based on the needs of the system and the impact to our customers, we decided that closing the entire tunnel for 18 months was the best approach to the rebuilding process. Now that the decision is made, we are committed to soliciting your feedback on plans for alternative services, and keeping you informed once work begins. We invite you to visit our Canarsie Tunnel Reconstruction microsite: http://web.mta.info/sandy/rebuildingCanarsieTunnel.html which is maintained for this very purpose. Our goal is to continuously provide you with content relevant to the project work, and enhance the information to reflect your questions, interests and concerns. We encourage you to explore the microsite where you will find photographs, maps, a cross section of the tunnel, and overall details that illustrate the work needed to both fix and fortify the tunnel as well as to bring added improvements to adjacent stations and capacity. This $800 million project will not only ensure greater resiliency of our infrastructure against weather events like Superstorm Sandy, but greater reliability of service for hundreds of thousands of L riders daily. As a person who has subscribed to receive email updates, you will automatically receive news and information about the project. We value your contribution to this process, and thank you for participating.
