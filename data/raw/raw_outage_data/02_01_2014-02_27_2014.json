As a result, Branch Line service was expanded, allowing for the ability to operate more than one train along the corridor at a time. Recently, a problem with the newly installed computerized train detection system that controls the grade crossings was identified. Despite the fact that this system was comprehensively tested at each crossing prior to being activated along the right-of-way, the mechanism that controls the opening and closing of a gate crossing sometimes activates with no trains approaching. We are working on finding a permanent fix. In the meantime, we have modified the system’s operation and have put into place a procedure to operate trains safely.
