Two more workshops are scheduled. Input from the meetings will inform the ongoing studies and traffic modeling exercises. Last Thursday, customers gathered at Our Lady of Guadalupe, and, the week before that, at the Williamsburg High School for Architecture & Design to hear presentations, discuss service options, and provide feedback to officials from the MTA and NYCDOT. Participants engaged in interactive discussions about how they currently use the transit system and how their trips may change during the closure. Information received at the workshops will be considered as representatives develop alternative service plans for when the tunnel is closed for reconstruction.
