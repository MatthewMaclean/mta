At approximately 5:30 PM, the height of the PM rush hour, a train struck a downed tree on our tracks in the vicinity of Crestwood. This took one of two tracks between Crestwood and Scarsdale out of service. Crews were immediately dispatched to remove the fallen tree. However, this incident was further complicated by the fact that there was damage to the third rail on the remaining track. As a result, trains could not operate through the area until the tree was removed at approximately 7PM. Trains were then able to operate on one track in the area but with the high volume of train traffic, delays quickly built from 20 to 90-plus minutes. Crews successfully completed track and third rail repairs at approximately 9:30 PM.
