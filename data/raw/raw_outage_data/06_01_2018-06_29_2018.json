Signal maintainers manually operated switches to allow trains to begin moving safely on only two inside tracks at 6 PM. The other two tracks remained out of service; limiting our ability to operate trains through the area. This caused delays of 40 to 90 minutes and required westbound trains to bypass Green's Farms, Westport and East Norwalk Stations. By 8 PM we were able to operate on another track, restoring service to the three affected stations and operating with residual delays of 10-15 minutes.

We've done our research and heard from riders (maybe you contributed through a survey or community event), and using your invaluable input, performance data, and rider models, we've reimagined Staten Island's express bus network to: - Make your ride faster by reducing the time spent getting you from point A to point B - Create more direct routes that riders want by streamlining stops in Staten Island and Manhattan - Increase off-peak service Everyone will have a new route and some (about a quarter of riders) will use a new bus stop close to the current one; almost all new stops are within a five minute walk. We have maps and information about your new route options to Midtown and Downtown Manhattan online now at http://bit.ly/SIExpressBus and will have more information and new tools to help you plan trips soon. Until then, you can see how we designed a win-win solution for Staten Island, and what the future of bus service looks like across the city: http://bit.ly/SIBusVideo This is just the first step of Fast Forward, our plan to modernize your transit system.

We've done our research and heard from riders (maybe you contributed through a survey or community event), and using your invaluable input, performance data, and rider models, we've reimagined Staten Island's express bus network to: - Make your ride faster by reducing the time spent getting you from point A to point B - Create more direct routes that riders want by streamlining stops in Staten Island and Manhattan - Increase off-peak service Everyone will have a new route and some (about a quarter of riders) will use a new bus stop close to the current one; almost all new stops are within a five minute walk. We have maps and information about your new route options to Midtown and Downtown Manhattan online now at http://bit.ly/SIExpressBus and will have more information and new tools to help you plan trips soon. Until then, you can see how we designed a win-win solution for Staten Island, and what the future of bus service looks like across the city: http://bit.ly/SIBusVideo This is just the first step of Fast Forward, our plan to modernize your transit system.
