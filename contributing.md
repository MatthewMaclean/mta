# Contributing to this project

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The station accessibility graphs and crosswalk file are put together as best as we could by automating a lot of processing. But we do recognize that there might be some inconsistencies, ommisions, or errors. If you do encounter these, we would hugely appreciate if you could create an issue detailing what the correct mapping should look like. We're keen to review these and incorporate your insights into our work!
