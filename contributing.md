# Contributing to this project

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The station accessibility graphs and crosswalk file are put together as best as we could by automating a lot of processing involved. But we do recgnize that there might be some inconsistencies and mapping we might have missed. If you do encounter these, we would hugely appretiate if you could create an issue detailing what the correct mapping should look like and we'd incorporate these into our work!
